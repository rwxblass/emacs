   <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/09/23/trump-keeps-telling-us-how-he-and-republicans-plan-steal-election">Can we stop him and save our republic before it's too late</a>?*

  <p>
  Is "steal" the correct word?  The final step would use a loophole in
  the Constitution,  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/09/23/report-trump-campaign-actively-discussing-radical-measures-to-bypass-election-results/#345778e04800">and that <em>a such</em> would not be stealing it</a>.
    But the first step is a fraudulent accusation of fraud, and I think that
  would justify the word "steal".

  <p>
  Why are Republicans in control of all the swing states' legislatures?
  Some of those states now vote majority Democrat, but gerrymandering
  has prevented the voters from electing legislators that reflect their
  views.

  Climate activists call <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2020/09/23/over-100-groups-oppose-democrats-energy-bill-insufficient">for defeat of the Congressional Democrats'
  inadequate energy bill</a>.

  <p>
  The article says that passing that bill would by a "Pyrrhic" victory,
  which is incorrect use of the word.  "Pyrrhic" describes a victory won
  at such a great cost that you can't afford to win another.  (King
  Pyrrhos of Epirus said that about his victory over Rome.)  This bill
  would be, rather, a dummy victory.

  The oil companies' conservation plans <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2020/09/23/big-oil-reality-check-new-paper-finds-failure-across-board-oil-industry-climate">are also drastically inadequate</a>.
